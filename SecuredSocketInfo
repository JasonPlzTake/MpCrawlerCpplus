HTTPS vs http?

443 port, Bad incorrect request caused 

I would suggest downloading the command-line curl and running that in verbose mode against the same target. 
HTTPS might be the solution handle ssl hand shaking
SSL/TLS encryption, but you are not initiating & completing an SSL/TLS handshake before sending your HTTP request. You need to use Microsoft's SChannel, or a 3rd part library like OpenSSL, on top of your socket connection to handle the SSL/TLS portion. You are not going to be able to implement that manually from scratch, it is way too complex for beginners

What is TLS ?

Secured Socket Approach:
1) MS Secured Socket Extension, socket handle TLS, but limited to use of IPsec protocol ONLY.
2) SChannel (built-in Windows SSL/TLS library)
3) OpenSSL third party lib

On Windows, if you want the socket to manage security for you, you need to use Winsock Secure Socket Extensions instead.
Otherwise, use an SSL/TLS library that runs on top of a standard socket, such as Microsoftâ€™s SChannel, or a 3rd party library like OpenSSL.
